Introduction

Open Dynamic Architecture is an ambitious project to orchestrate a comprehensive body of knowledge around dynamic capabilities within organizations. This project explores the tenets of dynamic capabilities, their interrelations, and how they can be harnessed to foster innovation, adaptability, and sustained competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business landscape. By creating an open-source repository of knowledge and resources, we aim to build a collaborative platform for scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts to contribute, learn, and apply dynamic capabilities in real-world scenarios.

What are Dynamic Capabilities?

Dynamic capabilities refer to a firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments. These capabilities enable organizations to:

**Sense:** Identify and assess opportunities and threats in the environment.
**Seize:** Mobilize resources to address opportunities and mitigate threats.
**Transform:** Continually realign and reconfigure the organization's resource base.
Project Structure

Below is a tentative structure of directories and files to organize the repository and facilitate the collaborative building of this body of knowledge.
